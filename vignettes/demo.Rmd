###  This is the library `projectG1` and it contains the function: `run_tracker()`.

### To access this function you must run the following 3 lines of code in the console:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("ptds2021/projectG1")
library(projectG1)
run_tracker()
```

### This function automatically runs our shiny application where you can track covid19 in European countries. The first tab displays a map where you can find the vaccination rate, the covid19 case by country and the deaths. All these metrics can be moved backwards in time with a side bar.
