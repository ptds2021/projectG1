# European COVID-19 tracker 

## Background 
We would like to introduce a useful online interactive dashboard that visualizes and tracks confirmed cases of COVID-19 in real-time across Europe. This dashboard is intended as a user-friendly dashboard for researchers as well as the general public to track the COVID-19 pandemic and evolution since the vaccinations began. It is generated from trusted data sources and built in open-source R software (Shiny) providing transparency. The R Shiny framework serves as a platform for visualization and analysis of the data providing real-time statistical application aiming to make sense to academic and public consumers of the large amount of data that is being accumulated due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our aim is for users to have a set of relevant pages displaying key COVID-19 statistics interactively, like the ability to change the country, date, and statistics they wish to view. The goal of this project is to also showcase the strengths of data science to tackle one of the world’s most difficult problems: predict and track the effect of pandemic on daily lives. Being designed as a cross-platform web-browser accessible dashboard (portal) to display massive data, the R Shiny environment provides a platform for end-users to interact and visualize the data according to their needs. 

## Code
Code and input data used to generate this Shiny mapping tool are available on Github.
